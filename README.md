# Fastify Server :

## Overview

The Fastify-App is a RESTful API server built using the Fastify framework in Node.js.
It provides endpoints for managing user data, including creating, reading, updating, and deleting user records.
The API follows best practices for RESTful architecture, utilizing clear and intuitive endpoint URLs and HTTP methods. 
Each endpoint is documented with Swagger documentation to facilitate ease of use and integration. Additionally, 
the Fastify-App is designed  to handle concurrent requests efficiently.
